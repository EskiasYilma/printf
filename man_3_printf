.B The conversion specifier
.br
.RS 3
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The
conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
.TP
.B d, i
The \fIint\fR argument is converted to signed decimal notation. The
precision, if any, gives the minimum number of digits that must
appear; if the converted value requires fewer digits, it is
padded on the left with zeros. The default precision is 1. When
0 is printed with an explicit precision 0, the output it empty.
.LP
.TP
.B c
The \fIint\fR argument is converted to an \fIunsigned char\fR, and the
resulting character is written.
.LP
.TP
.B s
The \fIconst char *\fR argument is expected to be a pointer to an array
of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are
written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\0').
